# ThingSpeak Communication Library for Particle

This library enables Particle hardware to write or read data to or from ThingSpeak, an open data platform for the Internet of Things with MATLAB analytics and visualization.

ThingSpeak offers free data storage and analysis of time-stamped numeric or alphanumeric data. Users can access ThingSpeak by visiting https://thingspeak.com and creating a ThingSpeak user account.

ThingSpeak stores data in channels. Channels support an unlimited number of timestamped observations (think of these as rows in a spreadsheet). Each channel has up to 8 fields (think of these as columns in a speadsheet). Check out this [video](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/introduction-to-thingspeak-107749.html) for an overview.

Channels may be public, where anyone can see the data, or private, where only the owner and select users can read the data. Each channel has an associated Write API Key that is used to control who can write to a channel. In addition, private channels have one or more Read API Keys to control who can read from private channel. An API Key is not required to read from public channels.  Each channel can have up to 8 fields. One field is created by default.

You can visualize and do online analytics of your data on ThingSpeak using the built-in version of MATLAB, or use the desktop version of MATLAB to get deeper historical insight. Visit https://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/thingspeak.html to learn more.

# Some Quick Examples

## Write to a Channel Field
```
#include "ThingSpeak.h"

TCPClient client;

unsigned long myChannelNumber = 31461;	// change this to your channel number
const char * myWriteAPIKey = "LD79EOAAWRVYF04Y"; // change this to your channels write API key

void setup() {
	ThingSpeak.begin(client);
}

void loop() {
	// read the input on analog pin 0:
	int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
	
	// Write to ThingSpeak, field 1, immediately
	ThingSpeak.writeField(myChannelNumber, 1, sensorValue, myWriteAPIKey);
	delay(20000); // ThingSpeak will only accept updates every 15 seconds.
}

```
## Write to a Multiple Channel fields at once
```
#include "ThingSpeak.h"

TCPClient client;

unsigned long myChannelNumber = 31461;	// change this to your channel number
const char * myWriteAPIKey = "LD79EOAAWRVYF04Y"; // change this to your channel write API key

void setup() {
	ThingSpeak.begin(client);
}

void loop(){
	// read the input on analog pins 1, 2 and 3:
	int sensorValue1 = analogRead(A1);
	int sensorValue2 = analogRead(A2);
	int sensorValue3 = analogRead(A3);
	
	// set fields one at a time
	ThingSpeak.setField(1,sensorValue1);
	ThingSpeak.setField(2,sensorValue2);
	ThingSpeak.setField(3,sensorValue3);
	
	// set the status if over the threshold
	if(sensorValue1 > 100){
		ThingSpeak.setStatus("ALERT! HIGH VALUE");
	}
	
	// Write the fields that you've set all at once.
	ThingSpeak.writeFields(myChannelNumber, myWriteAPIKey);
	
	delay(20000); // ThingSpeak will only accept updates every 15 seconds.
}

```
## Read from a Public Channel
```
#include "ThingSpeak.h"

TCPClient client;

unsigned long weatherStationChannelNumber = 12397;

void setup() { 
  ThingSpeak.begin(client);
}

void loop(){
	
	// Read latest measurements from the weather station in Natick, MA
	float temperature = ThingSpeak.readFloatField(weatherStationChannelNumber,4);
	float humidity = ThingSpeak.readFloatField(weatherStationChannelNumber,3);
	
	Particle.publish("thingspeak-weather", "Current weather conditions in Natick: ",60,PRIVATE);
	Particle.publish("thingspeak-weather", String(temperature) + " degrees F, " + String(humidity) + "% humidity",60,PRIVATE); 
	
	delay(60000); // Note that the weather station only updates once a minute

}
```
## Read from a Private Channel
```
#include "ThingSpeak.h"

TCPClient client;

unsigned long myChannelNumber = 31461;
const char * myReadAPIKey = "NKX4Z5JGO4M5I18A";

void setup() { 
  ThingSpeak.begin(client);
}

void loop(){
	
	 // Read the latest value from field 1 of channel 31461
	float value = ThingSpeak.readFloatField(myChannelNumber, 1, myReadAPIKey);
	
	Particle.publish("thingspeak-value", "Latest value is: " + String(value),60,PRIVATE);
	delay(30000);

}
```

## Read multiple fields from last feed ingested in a Channel
```
#include "ThingSpeak.h"

TCPClient client;

unsigned long weatherStationChannelNumber = 12397;

void setup() { 
  ThingSpeak.begin(client);
}

void loop(){

  // Read latest measurements from the weather station in Natick, MA
  // when reading from a private channel, pass the channel  ReadApi key
  statusCodeRead = ThingSpeak.readMultipleFields(weatherStationChannelNumber);
	
  // Wind Direction (North = 0 degrees)
  float windDirection = ThingSpeak.getFieldAsFloat(1);

  // Wind Speed (mph)
  float windSpeed = ThingSpeak.getFieldAsFloat(2);

  // Humidity (%)
  float humidity = ThingSpeak.getFieldAsFloat(3);

  // Temperature (F)
	float temperature = ThingSpeak.getFieldAsFloat(4);

  // Rain (Inches/minute)
  float rain = ThingSpeak.getFieldAsFloat(5);

  // Pressure ("Hg)
	float pressure = ThingSpeak.getFieldAsFloat(6);

  // Power Level (V)
  float powerLevel = ThingSpeak.getFieldAsFloat(7);

  // Light Intensity
	float pressure = ThingSpeak.getFieldAsFloat(8);
	
	Particle.publish("thingspeak-weather", "Current weather conditions in Natick: ",60,PRIVATE);
	Particle.publish("thingspeak-weather", String(temperature) + " degrees F, " + String(humidity) + "% humidity",60,PRIVATE); 
	
	delay(60000); // Note that the weather station only updates once a minute

## readMultipleFields
Read all the field values, status message, location coordinates, and created-at timestamp associated with the latest feed to a ThingSpeak channel.
The values are stored in a struct, which holds all the 8 fields data, along with status, latitude, longitude, elevation and createdAt associated with the latest field.
To retrieve all the values, invoke these functions in order:
1. readMultipleFields
2. readMultipleFields helper functions

## Special Characters
Some characters require '%XX' style URL encoding before sending to ThingSpeak.  The writeField() and writeFields() methods will perform the encoding automatically.  The writeRaw() method will not.

| Character  | Encoding |
|------------|:---------|
|     "      | %22      |
|     %      | %25      |
|     &      | %26      |
|     +      | %2B      |
|     ;      | %3B      |

Control characters, ASCII values 0 though 31, are not accepted by ThingSpeak and will be ignored.  Extended ASCII characters with values above 127 will also be ignored. 

# Additional Examples

The library source includes several examples to help you get started. These are accessible in ThingSpeak library section of the Particle Web IDE.

* **CheerLights:** Reads the latest CheerLights color on ThingSpeak, and sets an RGB LED.
* **ReadLastTemperature:** Reads the latest temperature from the public MathWorks weather station in Natick, MA on ThingSpeak.
* **ReadPrivateChannel:** Reads the latest voltage value from a private channel on ThingSpeak.
* **ReadWeatherStation:** Reads the latest weather data from the public MathWorks weather station in Natick, MA on ThingSpeak.
* **WriteMultipleVoltages:** Reads analog voltages from pins A1-A6 and writes them to the fields of a channel on ThingSpeak.
* **WriteVoltage:** Reads an analog voltage from pin 0, converts to a voltage, and writes it to a channel on ThingSpeak.
